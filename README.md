# Jobs REST API
In this project, we develop A REST API with Go (or Golang) that performs CRUD (i.e., CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE) operations on jobs data saved on a PostgreSQL database.  

Tech stack: Go, PostgreSQL, Postman  

The project consists of these qualities:
- We work with structs and slices to create our model and store and pass data around.  
- We create a router to register our API endpoints and handler functions.
- We make use of technologies such as the PostgreSQL database for persisting records, Postman for making API requests, third party packages such as gorilla/mux for routing, and other packages for loading environment variables, making http requests, encoding and decoding JSON, performing string conversions and checking types.
- We refactor our code and create a modular file structure.
